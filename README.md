# 💎BioJewelry
  
BioJewellery offers eco-friendly jewelry made from natural products. This project, undertaken by the Argonauts team as our capstone project, is an end-to-end e-commerce web application built using the MERN stack.

The web application serves as an online jewelry store, providing customers with the ability to browse and purchase multiple products based on their preferences. It prioritizes user-friendliness and efficient navigation to enhance the overall shopping experience.

# ✨Key Features

 - Seamless e-commerce functionality for easy product selection and checkout.
 - Customer service options including feedback submission and return requests.
 - Inventory management and efficient handling of returns and feedback on the client side.

Our goal was to support the expansion of the client's jewelry business by providing more avenues for customers to access their merchandise.
